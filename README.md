Timeline visualisation of Quebec Politics Colors


This is a quick python program to display a timeline using PIL and BeautifullSoup.
The information is taken from wikipedia as source for displaying the winner of the elections.
From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Quebec.

Example of output:

![Elections to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec (1867-1900)](https://github.com/stevenaubertin/QcPoliticsVisu/blob/master/0.gif)

![Elections to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec (1904-1935)](https://github.com/stevenaubertin/QcPoliticsVisu/blob/master/1.gif)

![Elections to the Legislative Assembly of Quebec (1936-1973) ](https://github.com/stevenaubertin/QcPoliticsVisu/blob/master/2.gif)

![Elections to the National Assembly of Quebec (1976-2014)](https://github.com/stevenaubertin/QcPoliticsVisu/blob/master/3.gif)

I will work on a side feature that display as a new image or not a legend. Also
the next version should put together all the images to make a big timeline.
